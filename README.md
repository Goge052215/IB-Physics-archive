# IB-Physics & Chemistry-archive

A collection of notes for the old IB Physics specification and Chemistry, aimed at supporting students and teachers with the curriculum.

## Introduction

This repository offers notes covering the entire old specification of the IB Physics course and the IB Chemistry course, organized by topic for easy navigation.

## How to Use These Notes

- **Topics:** Each folder corresponds to a different topic in the IB Physics and Chemistry curriculums.
- **Examples & Practice:** Look for example problems and practice questions within each topic's folder to aid your learning.

The notes are categorized into the main topics of the old IB Physics specification, including:

1. Measurements and Uncertainties
2. Mechanics
3. Thermal Physics
4. Waves
5. Electricity and Magnetism
6. Circular Motion and Gravitation
7. Atomic, Nuclear, and Particle Physics
8. Energy Production
9. Option Topics

Explore each topic folder for detailed notes and exercises.

## Content Structure - Chemistry

Similarly, the Chemistry notes are organized into the main topics of the IB Chemistry specification, including:
