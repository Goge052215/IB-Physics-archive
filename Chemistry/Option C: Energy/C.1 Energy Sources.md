# C.1 Energy Sources

## Energy Density and Specific Energy

### Energy Density

Energy density is the amount of energy that can be released from an energy source in a given system or region of space per unit volume.

Energy density $= \frac{E}{V}$, units: $\text{J m}^{-3}$ or $\text{kJ m}^{-3}$

### Specific Energy

Specific energy is the amount of energy that can be released from an energy source per unit of mass.

Specific energy $= \frac{E}{m}$, units: $\text{J kg}^{-1}$ or $\text{kJ kg}^{-1}$

## Renewable Energy Source

Renewable energy sources are naturally replenished. This means that they are renewableÂ on a human timescale.

Common renewable energy source:
1. Solar
2. Tidal
3. Geothermal
4. Biomass
5. Wind
6. Hydroelectric
