# C.3 Nuclear Fusion and Fission

Nuclear reactions involve changes to the nucleus itself.

Particles in the nucleus are held together by the binding energy.

Isotopes with the most binding energy per nucleon are the most stable. Usually, $^{56}\text{Fe}$ has the highest binding energy. Elements lighter than $^{56}\text{Fe}$ become more stable by nuclear fusion, whereas heavier elements become more stable by nuclear fission.

Binding energy: $E = mc^2$

**Mass Defect**: the difference between the mass of the nucleus.

## Nuclear Fusion

Occurs when one small nucleus combines with another nucleus to form a larger and more stable nucleus.

For example, the reaction between a deuterium and a tritium nuclei:

$^3_1\text{H} + ^2_1\text{H} →\space ^4_2\text{He} + ^1_0n + E$

The nuclear fission reaction between a $^2\text{H}$ deuterium and a $^3\text{H}$ tritium releases a neutron, $^4\text{He}$helium, and an amount of energy. This reaction involves two smaller nuclei combined to form a larger nucleus.

## Nuclear Fission:

The process of breaking larger atomic nuclei into smaller nuclei by reacting with neutrons releasing a **large amount of energy** during the reaction.

- Mass lost is converted into energy
- Nuclear power stations use this heat to drive turbines to generate electricity

Nuclear fission of Uranium-235:

The image above illustrates a slow neutron hitting a fissionable U-235 nucleus, it is absorbed and forms an unstable U-236 nucleus. The U-236 nucleus then rapidly breaks apart into two smaller nuclei (in this case, Ba-141 and Kr-92) along with several neutrons (usually two or three), and releases a very large amount of energy.

Chain Reaction: occurs when the output of one nuclear reaction causes more nuclear reactions to occur.

*Note: This process goes on continually until the entire nuclei in the sample above undergo fission*

### Controlled & Uncontrolled Fission

Hazards of uncontrolled chain reaction:
- Massive explosion
- Huge amount of energy released

Controlled chain reaction:
- Moderator
- Control rods

## Composition of stars

- The composition of the stars can be deduced from their absorption spectra.
- Electrons are excited and absorb energy as they are promoted from lower to higher energy levels.
- The levels are different in each element, so each element has a characteristic absorption spectrum.
- Absorption spectra are the opposite of their emission spectra.

## Radioactive Decay Law

The rate of decay is **proportional to** the number of nuclei present that have not yet decayed:

$\frac{\Delta N}{\Delta t} = -\lambda N$

$\lambda$ is the decay constant

From this law, we know that the number of radioactive nuclei decreases exponentially; therefore, we can rewrite the equation into:

$\ln{\frac{[A]_t}{[A]_0}} = -\lambda t$

where $[A]_0$ is the initial concentration, $[A]_t$ is the concentration at the time $t$
### Half-life equation

Half-life means the time taken for a material to decay half of its substance, which means at the time of half-life, $[A]_t$ equals to 0.5.

Then we further derive the formula:

$\ln{\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1}} = -\ln{2} = -\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}$\
$t_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\ln{2}}{\lambda}$

## Nuclear safety

1. Leakage of radioactive material
2. Attack by terrorists
3. Risk of meltdown
4. Escape of radioactivity from the storage 
### Nuclear waste

High-level nuclear waste: Spent fuel rods contain highly radioactive material.
- Methods: vitrifying and burying

Low-level nuclear waste: Different sources including hospitals and research laboratories as well as nuclear plants.
- Method: store in large tanks of cooled water until it has lost most of its activity
