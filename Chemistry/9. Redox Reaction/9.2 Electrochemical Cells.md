## Voltaic Cells & Half-cells

Voltaic cells, also called galvanic cells, or batteries, **use a redox reaction** to produce an electric current.

A half-cell consists of an electrode, usually a metal, in a solution of its ions. For example, a zinc half-cell is composed of a piece of solid zinc metal in a solution of aqueous zinc ($\text{Zn}^{2+}$) ions.

A voltaic cells kit consists of:
- Two electrodes 
- Salt solutions
- A salt bridge
- Wires and a voltmeter

A simple salt bridge can be made from a strip of filter paper soaked in saturated potassium nitrate ($\text{KNO}_3$). Potassium nitrate is chosen because its constituent ions do not react with the other ions presented in the two half-cells, or with the electrodes.

**Key point:** Positive ions always move towards the positive electrode, or cathode, whereas negative ions always move towards the negative electrode, or anode.

The further to the left the equilibrium lies in the above half-equation, the more readily the atom loses electrons to form positive ions.
- More reactive metals, such as zinc, have a greater tendency to lose electrons as they are stronger reducing agents.
- Copper, a less reactive metal, has a lesser tendency to lose electrons.

**Remember:** More reactive metals will be the anode, whereas less reactive metals will be the cathode.

When combined in a voltaic cell, the more reactive metal 'drives' the direction of the equilibrium. The more reactive metal is oxidized, and the less reactive metal is reduced.

To simplify understanding, here is an example of voltaic cells of zinc and copper:

In this reaction, zinc is more reactive than copper, so zinc is oxidized and loses electrons. Copper is reduced and gains electrons; thus, electron flows from the anode ($\text{Zn}$) to the cathode ($\text{Cu}$). The negative sulfate ions (${\text{SO}_4}^{2-}$) move to the negative electrode (anode), the positive sodium ions ($\text{Na}^+$) move to the positive electrode (cathode).

### The Cell Potential

The cell potential ($E^{⦵}$ cell), also known as the electromotive force (EMF), is the difference in the electrode potentials of the half-cells in a voltaic cell. The cell potential of a voltaic cell is measured in volts ($\text{V}$).

The cell potential is the potential difference between cathode and anode:

$E^{⦵} = E_{\text{Cathode}} - E_{\text{Anode}}$

**Note:** The further apart in the reactivity series, the higher the cell potential is between two electrodes.

**Some common cell potentials:**

|  | Cell Potential ($\text{V}$) |
|:--|:--|
| Copper & magnesium | 2.71 |
| Copper & iron | 0.79 |
| Lead & zinc | 0.63 |
| Lead & iron | 0.32 |

### Cell Diagram Convention

The cell diagram convention is a shorthand method used to represent a voltaic cell. The figure below shows the application of this convention to a voltaic cell that consists of a zinc half-cell connected to a copper half-cell.

Such diagrams have the following features:

- A phase boundary between a solid and an aqueous solution is represented by a single vertical line.
- A salt bridge is represented by a double vertical line.
- The anode is usually placed on the left and the cathode on the right.
- Two types of ions in the same half-cell are separated by a comma.
- Spectator ions are not included in the diagram.

## Electrolytic Cells

### The movement of ions

The electrical conductivity of ionic compounds when molten or dissolved in aqueous solutions is explained by the fact that mobile ions move in a particular direction in an electric field, where:

- The positive ions are attracted to the cathode (the negative electrode). 
- The negative ions are attracted to the anode (the positive electrode).

### Electrolysis of molten ionic compounds

The anode is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and the cathode is connected to the negative terminal

- Negative ions, or anions, are attracted to the anode
- Positive ions, or cations, are attracted to the cathode

## Comparison: Voltaic Cell & Electrolytic Cell

| Voltaic cell | Electrolytic cell |
|:--|:--|
| Oxidation occurs at the negative anode | Oxidation occurs at the positive anode |
| Reduction occurs at the positive cathode | Reduction occurs at the negative cathode |
| Involves an exothermic spontaneous redox reaction | Involves an endothermic non-spontaneous redox reaction |
| Cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy | Cell converts electrical energy into chemical energy |
| The cathode is positive and the anode is negative during discharge | The cathode is negative and the anode is positive during electrolysis  |
| The cell uses two separate aqueous solutions connected by a salt bridge and an external circuit | The electrolyte is a molten liquid (or an aqueous solution) |
| Electric current is conducted by the electrons in the external circuit and the movement of ions in the salt bridge | Electric current is conducted by the electrons in the external circuit and the movement of ions in the electrolyte |
