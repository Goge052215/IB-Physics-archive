# 9.1 Oxidation and Reduction

## Definitions of Oxidation and Reduction

Oxidation and reduction are defined in different ways. **Oxidation was originally defined as the gain of oxygen and reduction is the loss of oxygen**. Oxidation and reduction always happen at the same time: if one reactant is oxidized during a reaction, then another reactant must be reduced. The reaction is referred to as a redox reaction.

Let's take an example:

$\text{CuO} + \text{H}_2 → \text{Cu} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$

In this reaction, the copper oxide ($\text{CuO}$) loses oxygen to form copper metal, which is reduction. The hydrogen gas gains oxygen to form water, which is oxidation. 

The definitions of oxidation and reduction were extended to include reactions involving the loss or gain of hydrogen, mostly used in organic chemistry. For example, in the following reaction, ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$) is reduced to ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$) by the addition of hydrogen:

$\text{C}_2\text{H}_4 (\text{g}) + \text{H}_2 (\text{g}) → \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 (\text{g})$

To remember the original definitions of oxidation and reaction, it is effective to remember the mnemonics of 'OILRIG', where:

- Oxidation Is the Loss of electrons
- Reduction Is the Gain of electrons

as shown in the figure below:

As intended, these new definitions of oxidation and reduction increase the number of reactions that can be classified as redox reactions.

For example, solid zinc reacts with aqueous copper sulfate to produce aqueous zinc sulfate and solid copper according to the following equation:

$\text{Zn} (\text{s}) + \text{CuSO}_4 (\text{aq}) → \text{ZnSO}_4 (\text{aq}) + \text{Cu} (\text{s})$

In this case, zinc is **oxidized** because it **lost 2 electrons** from this reaction, whereas copper ions are **reduced** from a **gain of 2 electrons**.

Here are the half equations:

$\text{Zn} → \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\text{e}^-$\
$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\text{e}^- → \text{Cu}$

In this way, we can see which species has gained electrons, and which has lost electrons. 

Oxidation results in an **increase in the oxidation state** and reduction results in a **decrease in the oxidation state**. Applying this idea to the reaction of zinc and copper sulfate, and using just two of the basic rules for assigning oxidation states, we get the following:

- Zinc: Increase its oxidation state from $0$ to $+2$
- Copper: Decrease its oxidation state from $+2$ to $0$

## Oxidizing & Reducing Agent

An oxidizing agent is a species that oxidizes another species. A reducing agent is a species that reduces another species. In other words, an oxidizing agent is reduced and a reducing agent is oxidized (shown in the figure below).

### How do we identify oxidizing & reducing agents?

- If the reactant accepts electrons → oxidizing agent
- If the reactant donates electrons → reducing agent

## Oxidation State

Oxidation state is a number which, together with its sign, indicates the gain or loss of electron control of an atom during a reaction.

|  | Rules for determining oxidation states |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | Free elements such as $\text{O}_2$, $\text{Cl}_2$, $\text{N}_2$, are assigned an oxidation state of zero. |
| 2 | The sum of the oxidation states of all the atoms in a compound must be equal to the net charge on the compound. (Charge conversation) |
| 3 | The alkali metals ($\text{Li}$, $\text{Na}$, $\text{K}$, $\text{Rb}$ and $\text{Cs}$) in compounds are always assigned an oxidation state of $+1$. |
| 4 | Fluorine in compounds is always assigned an oxidation state of $-1$. |
| 5 | The alkaline earth metals ($\text{Be}$, $\text{Mg}$, $\text{Ca}$, $\text{Sr}$, $\text{Ba}$ and $\text{Ra}$) and $\text{Zn}$ in compounds are always assigned an oxidation state of $+2$. |
| 6 | Hydrogen in compounds is assigned an oxidation state of +1, except in certain metal hydrides (e.g. $\text{NaH}$), where it is $-1$. |
| 7 | Oxygen in compounds is assigned an oxidation state of $-2$, except in peroxides (e.g. $\text{H}_2\text{O}_2$), where it is $-1$, or when it is combined with fluorine, in which it is $+2$. |
| 8 | Chlorine in compounds is assigned an oxidation state of $-1$ unless it is combined with oxygen or fluorine. |
| 9 | The charge on a metal ion is the same as its oxidation state, e.g. $\text{Zn}^{2+}$ has an oxidation state of $+2$. |
| 10 | The sum of the oxidation states in a polyatomic ion (such as $\text{CO}_3^{2−}$) must add up to the charge on the ion. |

### Worked examples

**Q1:** Determine the oxidation state of the carbon in carbonic acid, $\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$.

Oxidation State of $\text{CO}_3$: $0 - 2 = -2$\
$\therefore \text{C} = -2 - (-2 * 3) = -2 + 4 = +4$

Therefore, the oxidation state of carbon in carbonic acid is $+4$.

**Q2:** Determine the oxidation state of the nitrogen in the nitrate ion, ${\text{NO}_3}^−$.

$\text{N} = -1 - (-2 * 3) = -1 + 6 = +5$

Therefore, the oxidation state of nitrogen in nitrate ion is $+5$.

### Average oxidation state

Average oxidation state is the **average** of the oxidation states of the same atom in a compound.

An example is Fe in the compound $\text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4$; each oxygen in the compound has an oxidation state of $−2$, leaving each iron with an average oxidation state of $\frac{8}{3}$.

### Systematic name

Roman numerals are used to show the oxidation number when there is more than one possible oxidation state for an atom in a compound. For example, in copper (I) oxide, the copper has an oxidation number of $+1$, whereas in copper (II) oxide, it is $+2$.

| Name of compound | Defining oxidation number | Formula |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Iron (II) chloride | $+2$ | $\text{FeCl}_2$ |
| Iron (III) chloride | $+3$ | $\text{FeCl}_3$ |
| Sodium dichromate (VI) | $+6$ | $\text{Na}_2\text{Cr}_2\text{O}_7$ |
| Potassium manganate (VII) | $+7$ | $\text{K}\text{Mn}\text{O}_4$ |
| Potassium chlorate(V) | $+5$ | $\text{K}\text{Cl}\text{O}_3$ |

### Disproportionation reactions

Disproportionation occurs when the same species is oxidized and reduced simultaneously during a reaction to form two different products.

### Displacement reaction

In a displacement reaction, the more reactive metal (the metal higher up in the activity series) displaces the ions of the less reactive metal (the metal lower in the activity series) from the solution. They are redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons as metal atoms are oxidized and aqueous metal ions are reduced.

## Redox Reaction

### Balancing redox equations in acidic solution

We can use oxidation states to balance equations involving redox reactions in acidic solutions.

For example, manganate (VII) ions, ${\text{MnO}_4}^{–}$, react with $\text{Fe}^{2+}$ ions in an acidic solution ($\text{H}^+$) to form $\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ions, $\text{Fe}^{3+}$ ions and water. Here we will go through the steps involved to balance this redox equation.

**Step 1:** Determine, using oxidation states, what is being oxidized and reduced. Here, iron(II) ions are oxidized to iron(III) ions; ${\text{MnO}_4}^{–}$ ions are reduced to form $\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ions

$\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq}) → \text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq})$\
$\text{MnO}_4^{–}(\text{aq}) → \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq})$

**Step 2:** Balance for atoms, other than hydrogen or oxygen

**Step 3:** Balance for oxygen by adding H2O to the side that has fewer oxygen atoms：

${\text{MnO}_4}^{–}(\text{aq}) → \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$

**Step 4:** Balance for hydrogen by adding hydrogen ions ($\text{H}^+$) to the side with fewer hydrogen atoms:

$8\text{H}^+(\text{aq}) + {\text{MnO}_4}^{–}(\text{aq}) → \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$

**Step 5:** Balance each half-equation for charge by adding electrons ($\text{e}^–$) to the more positive side:

$5\text{e}^– + 8\text{H}^+(\text{aq}) + {\text{MnO}_4}^{–}(\text{aq}) → \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$

**Step 6:** Cancel out what appears on both sides of the arrow to get the overall equation:

$5\text{Fe}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 8\text{H}^+(\text{aq}) + {\text{MnO}_4}^{–}(\text{aq}) → 5\text{Fe}^{3+}(\text{aq}) + \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 4\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$

## The Winkler Method

The Winkler method is a technique used to measure the concentration of dissolved oxygen in a water sample.

$2\text{Mg}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + 4\text{OH}^{–}(\text{aq}) + \text{O}_2(\text{aq}) → 2\text{MnO}_2(\text{s}) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$\
$\text{MnO}_2(\text{s}) + 2\text{I}^−(\text{aq}) + 4\text{H}^+ (\text{aq}) → \text{Mn}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + \text{I}_2(\text{aq}) + 2\text{H}_2\text{O}(\text{l})$\
$2{\text{S}_2\text{O}_3}^{2−}(\text{aq}) + I2(\text{aq}) → {\text{S}_4\text{O}_6}^{2−}(\text{aq}) + 2\text{I}^−(\text{aq})$

Once the initial concentration of dissolved oxygen is known, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the sample after five days is calculated in the same way.
