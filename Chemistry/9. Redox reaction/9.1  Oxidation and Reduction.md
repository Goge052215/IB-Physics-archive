# 9.1 Oxidation and Reduction

## Definitions of Oxidation and Reduction

Oxidation and reduction are defined in different ways. **Oxidation was originally defined as the gain of oxygen and reduction is the loss of oxygen**. Oxidation and reduction always happen at the same time: if one reactant is oxidized during a reaction, then another reactant must be reduced. The reaction is referred to as a redox reaction.

Let's take an example:

$\text{CuO} + \text{H}_2 → \text{Cu} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$

In this reaction, the copper oxide ($\text{CuO}$) loses oxygen to form copper metal, which is reduction. The hydrogen gas gains oxygen to form water, which is oxidation. 

The definitions of oxidation and reduction were extended to include reactions involving the loss or gain of hydrogen, mostly used in organic chemistry. For example, in the following reaction, ethene ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_4$) is reduced to ethane ($\text{C}_2\text{H}_6$) by the addition of hydrogen:

$\text{C}_2\text{H}_4 (\text{g}) + \text{H}_2 (\text{g}) → \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 (\text{g})$

To remember the original definitions of oxidation and reaction, it is effective to remember the mnemonics of 'OILRIG', where:

- Oxidation Is to Lose electrons
- Reduction Is to Gain electrons

as shown in the figure below:

As intended, these new definitions of oxidation and reduction increase the number of reactions that can be classified as redox reactions.

For example, solid zinc reacts with aqueous copper sulfate to produce aqueous zinc sulfate and solid copper according to the following equation:

$\text{Zn} (\text{s}) + \text{CuSO}_4 (\text{aq}) → \text{ZnSO}_4 (\text{aq}) + \text{Cu} (\text{s})$

In this case, zinc is **oxidized** because it **lost 2 electrons** from this reaction, whereas copper ions are **reduced** from a **gain of 2 electrons**.

Here are the half equations:

$\text{Zn} → \text{Zn}^{2+} + 2\text{e}^-$\
$\text{Cu}^{2+} + 2\text{e}^- → \text{Cu}$

In this way, we can see which species has gained electrons, and which has lost electrons. 

Oxidation results in an **increase in the oxidation state** and reduction results in a **decrease in the oxidation state**. Applying this idea to the reaction of zinc and copper sulfate, and using just two of the basic rules for assigning oxidation states, we get the following:

- Zinc: Increase its oxidation state from $0$ to $+2$
- Copper: Decrease its oxidation state from $+2$ to $0$

## Oxidizing & Reducing Agent

An oxidizing agent is a species that oxidizes another species. A reducing agent is a species that reduces another species. In other words, an oxidizing agent is reduced and a reducing agent is oxidized (shown in the figure below).

### How do we identify oxidizing & reducing agents?

- If the reactant accepts electrons → oxidizing agent
- If the reactant donates electrons → reducing agent
