## 1. Internal Energy and Work done

Internal energy is the sum of the random kinetic energy of the molecules and their total potential energy.

Hence, for an ideal gas, the internal energy is just the total kinetic energy of all its molecules.

We know that the average kinetic energy ($\overline{E_k}$) of a gas molecule is proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas ($T$) only and is given by:

$\overline{E_k} = \frac{3}{2}k_B T$

where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

Assume there are $N$ gas particles, each of which has an average kinetic energy of $\frac{3}{2}k_B T$, the total internal energy $U$ will be:

$U = N × \frac{3}{2}k_B T$

Using $R = k_B × N_A$ where Ris the ideal gas constant and $N_A$ is the Avogadro’s number:

$U = \frac{3}{2} × N ×\frac{R}{N_A} T$

because $n = \frac{N}{N_A}$,

$U = \frac{3}{2} nRT$
