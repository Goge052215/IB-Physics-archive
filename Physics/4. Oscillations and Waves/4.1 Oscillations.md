# 4.1 Oscillations

## 1. Waves

**Waves** are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without the permanent displacement of the medium through which they travel. 

Waves are characterized by their wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed.

**Wavelength** ($\lambda$) is the length of the wave that transfers energy in one time period ($T$), **amplitude** ($x_0$) is the maximum displacement of the wave and **frequency** ($f$) is the number of oscillations completed per unit time.

Because frequency measures the number of oscillation(s) per second, it can be mathematically expressed as:

$\displaystyle f=\frac{1}{T}$ or $\displaystyle T=\frac{1}{f}$

To calculate the speed of a wave ($v$), we use the SUVAT formula of $\displaystyle v=\frac{s}{t}$. With distance $s$ is the wavelength, time $t$ is the time when 1 full period elapses:

$\displaystyle v=\frac{s}{t}=\lambda\times\frac{1}{T}=\lambda\times f$

hence, $v=\lambda f$

## 2. Simple Harmonic Motion

**Simple Harmonic Motion** (SHM) is a type of periodic motion or oscillation motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to that of displacement.

### Characteristics of SHM:

1. **Restoring Force:** The force that brings the object back to its equilibrium position is called the restoring force. In SHM, this force is proportional to the negative of the displacement from the equilibrium position, mathematically described as $F = -kx$, where $F$ is the restoring force, $k$ is the spring constant, and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.
2. **Periodic Motion:** SHM is periodic, meaning that the motion repeats itself in a regular cycle. The object oscillates back and forth over the same path, passing through the equilibrium position twice during each cycle. In this way, the direction of force will always be opposite to the direction of the motion.
3. **Constant Energy:** The energy in simple harmonic motion oscillates between potential energy stored in the restoring force and kinetic energy of the moving object. The total energy remains constant if there's no external force acting on the system.

### Graphing SHM

1. **Identify Parameters:** Determine the amplitude $A$, which is the maximum value of $x(t)$. This tells you how far from the equilibrium position (usually represented as $x=0$) the object moves. Then determine the initial position of ($x_0$) and time period ($T$).
2. **Plot the Curve:** Note that when $\displaystyle t = \frac{T}{4}$, $\displaystyle t = \frac{T}{2}$, $\displaystyle t = \frac{3T}{4}$, and $\displaystyle t = T$, the displacement $x(t)$ will be at key points: maximum displacement, passing through equilibrium, minimum displacement, and returning to equilibrium, respectively.
3. Continue plotting points for $x(t)$ at various times $t$ and connect them with a smooth sine or cosine curve.

**Example:**

If you have an SHM equation $x(t) = 5 \cos{2t}$, the amplitude $A$ has $5$ units, and the angular frequency $\omega = 2 \text{ rad/s}$. The period $\displaystyle T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \pi$ seconds.

- On the vertical axis, your scale should at least cover from $-5$ to $5$. 
- On the horizontal axis, choose a scale that covers at least $\pi$ seconds.
- At $t=0, x(0)=5\cos{0}=5,$ the motion starts at the maximum displacement.
- The graph will show a cosine wave oscillating between $-5$ to $5$, with a period of $\pi$ seconds.

### Phase Difference

**Phase difference** refers to the difference in the phase angle between two points in time within a cycle of a wave or between two different waves oscillating at the same frequency.

It measures how much one wave or oscillation is shifted relative to another. When the phase difference is $T$ or $0$ then two waves (systems) are said to be **in phase**.
