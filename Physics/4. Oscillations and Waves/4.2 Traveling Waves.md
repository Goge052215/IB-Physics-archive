# 4.2 Traveling Waves

## 1. Traveling Waves

### Transverse Waves

**Transverse waves** are a type of wave where the oscillation of the medium is **perpendicular** to the direction of the wave's propagation. This means that the movement of the particles in the medium is at right angles to the direction in which the wave travels.

Examples of transverse waves: light waves

### Longitudinal Waves

**Longitudinal waves** are a type of wave in which the particle displacement is **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation. This means that the particles of the medium through which the wave travels move back and forth in the same direction as the wave itself:

Longitudinal waves are characterized by regions of compression, where particles are closer together, and rarefactions, where particles are farther apart.
