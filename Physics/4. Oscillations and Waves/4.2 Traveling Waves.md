## 1. Traveling Waves

### Transverse Waves

**Transverse waves** are a type of wave where the oscillation of the medium is **perpendicular** to the direction of the wave's propagation. This means that the movement of the particles in the medium is at right angles to the direction in which the wave travels.

Examples of transverse waves: light waves

### Longitudinal Waves

**Longitudinal waves** are a type of wave in which the particle displacement is **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation. This means that the particles of the medium through which the wave travels move back and forth in the same direction as the wave itself:

Longitudinal waves are characterized by regions of compression, where particles are closer together, and rarefactions, where particles are farther apart.

## 2. Sound and Light Waves

**Sound waves** are a type of mechanical wave that results from the **vibration of particles** in a medium (such as air, water, or solids). They are longitudinal waves, meaning that the oscillation of the particles in the medium is parallel to the direction of the wave's propagation.

The speed of sound varies depending on the medium through which it travels. Sound travels faster in solids, slower in liquids, and travels slower in gases. For example, the speed of sound in air at room temperature is approximately **343** meters per second (m/s).

**Light waves** are a type of **electromagnetic wave** (EM) capable of traveling through the vacuum of space and various media like air, water, and transparent solids. They travel at the speed of $3\times 10^{8}\text{ms}^{-1}$ in vacuum.

EM waves propagate as a transverse wave through a medium or a vacuum by oscillations of coupled, time-varying electric and magnetic fields.

### Types of EM waves

| EM waves           | Wavelength                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Radio waves        | $1\space\text{mm}-100\space\text{km}$ |
| Microwaves         | $1\space\text{mm}-30\space\text{cm}$  |
| Infrared radiation | $1-1000\space\mu\text{m}$             |
| UV radiation       | $100-400\space\text{nm}$              |
| X-rays             | $30\space\text{pm}-3\space\text{nm}$  |
| Gamma rays         | $\lt\space 1\text{pm}$                |
