## 1.  Electric Charge

Take two polyethylene rods and rub each with a piece of cloth (wool) or fur (rabbit or mole). Make a mark on the rods with a pen so that you know which end has been rubbed (charged).

Place one of the rods on a simple paper hanger. Bring the two charged ends towards each other. *What happens? Why?*

Now do the same with two acrylic (or glass) rods. *What happens? Why?*

Now bring a charged polyethylene rod towards the charged acrylic rod (in hanger). *What happens? Why?*

Electric charge is a characteristic of matter. Normally, matter appears to be electrically neutral. However, if we take two polyethylene rods and rub them with a piece of wool, we find that the two rods repel each other. Similarly, if we rub two acrylic or glass rods with a cloth, we find that the acrylic rods repel each other. But if one of the acrylic rods is charged, it attracts the charged polyethylene rod.

**Charge** is a scalar property of matter that can cause it to experience a force in an electromagnetic field (electric or magnetic). Charge types may only be positive or negative (an arbitrary naming convention).

### The Tolman-Stewart Experiment

The Tolman-Stewart effect is a phenomenon in which inertia causes the electrons in the body to "lag" behind the overall motion.

Considering linear acceleration, negative charges accumulate at the end of the body; while for rotation, they accumulate at the outer rim.

### Properties of electric charge

Charge can be either **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

This means that charge is a **scalar property** of matter that can cause it to experience a force in an electromagnetic field (electric or magnetic). Even so, it could only have charge of $1.6×10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

**Note**
Charge is conserved: During elementary particle reactions, the total charge in a closed system remains constant. If particles are created from transformed energy then the net charge of the new particles is zero.

## 2. Columb's Law

**Coulomb's law** states: The electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

$F_{\text{Force of charge}} = k \displaystyle \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$

where $k$ is the constant. $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges, $r$ is the separation of two charges.

$k = \displaystyle \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} = 8.99 \times 10^9 \text{ Nm}^2\text{C}^{-2}$ 

$\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum

**Nb:** Positive or negative charge values are included with physical values and calculated according to the usual mathematical rules. Columb's Law only applies to point charges. It cannot be used directly to calculate the force between charges distributed through and on irregularly shaped electrical conductors or insulators, or between parallel metal plates that would normally have the charge distributed evenly over their surface.

## 3. Electric Fields

A [vector field](https://app.kognity.com/study/app/2024-physics-12b/sid-49-cid-159642/book/defining-scalars-vectors-id-2137/) that associates to each point in space the Coulomb force that would be experienced per unit of electric charge, by an infinitesimal test charge at that point.

The **electric field strength** is the magnitude of the force per unit charge on an infinitesimal positive test charge placed in the field.

$E = \displaystyle \frac{F}{q}$

$F$ is the electrical force, $q$ is the charge of the positive test charge. The unit of the electric field strength is $\text{NC}^{-1}$.

### Electric Field Strength in Spheres

For a uniformly charged sphere with a radius $r$, the electric field strength varies with distance from the center:

$E = k \displaystyle \frac{Q}{R^3} \space (R < r)$

$E = k \displaystyle \frac{Q}{R^2} \space (R > r)$

### Electric Potential

**Electric potential** (V) is defined as electrical potential energy per unit charge at a particular point in the field.

The potential is calculated from

$\displaystyle V = \frac{W}{q}$

where $W$ is the work done by some force external to the field to bring a small test charge $q$ from $\infty$ to the point.

Therefore, from the definition, $V_{\infty} = 0$

Electric potential is a scalar, which could be negative, each point has only one scalar electric potential. Since it is defined as work done $V$ divided by charge $q$, its unit is $\text{J}\text{C}^{-1}$.

### Potential difference

**Potential difference** is the difference of electric potentials taken at two different points. 

Assume the potential at point A is $V_{\text{A}}$, the potential at point B is $V_{\text{B}}$, the potential difference from A to B is:

$\Delta V = V_{\text{B}} - V_{\text{A}}$

When $\Delta V = 0$ we call the points **equipotential**. No work is done when moving between the points.

### Properties of electric fields

The electric field is a vector field that has a strength expressed as a force per unit charge and a direction at every point in space. We can approximately visualize the electric field by drawing electric field lines.

Two different electric field lines, as shown above, illustrate two different scenarios for 2 identical charges and 1 positive + 1 negative charge.

**Note:** Equipotential and electric field lines are always mutually perpendicular at the same point, as no work is done in moving along an equipotential line or surface. The spacing of equipotential lines is proportional to the magnitude of the electric field, which is negative of the gradient of the potential field.

### Electronvolt

The **electron-volt** ( $\text{e}V$ ) is the amount of energy needed to move an electron through a potential difference of one volt.

## 4. Current Flow

An **electric current**, $I$, is the rate of flow of charge past a given cross-section of material or space. It is calculated as:

$I = \displaystyle \frac{q}{t}$

Where $q$ is the charge pass through, and $t$ is the time elapsed.

The SI unit of current is **Ampere**, known as $\text{A}$. The 'ampere' is a base unit defined as the current that produces $2 × 10^{−7} \text{ Nm}$ between two infinitely long parallel conductors of negligible cross-sectional area, separated by 1 m in a vacuum.

### Current in metals

**The figure below** shows a short section of a metal wire with a constant cross-sectional area $A$.  The conventional current of magnitude $I$ flow in the direction shown; remember that this is the same as a flow of negative charge in the opposite direction.

Let the charge on each electron be $q$,  and assume an electron density in the metal of  $n$ electrons per unit volume. Additionally, let us assume that all of the electrons have an average drift speed $v$.  In a time interval $\Delta t$ all electrons within the cylindrical volume of the area $A$ and length $v\Delta t$ will have passed out of the end face of the cylinder.  The total charge that left the cylinder is $\Delta Q = n(Av\Delta t)q$, (the number of electrons multiplied by the charge on the electron).

Because current is defined as $\Delta Q$ divided by $\Delta t$, we can reform the equation into:

$\displaystyle \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = I = nAvq$

## Key Formulas

### Columb's Law

$\displaystyle F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$

### Electric Fields

$\displaystyle E = \frac{F}{q}$

$\displaystyle V = \frac{W}{q}$

$I = nAvq$
