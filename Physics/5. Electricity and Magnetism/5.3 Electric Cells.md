# 5.3 Electric Cells

## 1. Electromotive Force

**Electromotive force** (**emf)** The electromotive force (emf) is the energy per unit charge, also known as voltage, that is provided by a source like a generator or cell. It is usually represented by the symbol $\epsilon$. 

The emf is the total electric potential energy that is supplied to the entire circuit, including the energy that is dissipated as internal energy inside the battery.

## 2. Internal Resistance

The **internal resistance** of a cell is the electrical resistance associated with the electrochemical reactions within it.

Often, we denote the internal resistance as $r$ instead of capital R.

Assume that a circuit has a current of $I$ passes through and the emf across the terminal is $V$. While without the internal resistance, the total resistance is $R$ (assume there is only one resistor with a resistance of $R$), the total resistance with the internal resistance is $(R + r)$. 

Because emf of the cell $\epsilon$ is the multiplication of the current $I$ and the total resistance $\sum R$, we can transform the formula as:

$\displaystyle \epsilon = I \times \sum R = I(R + r)$

The emf of the cell terminal is the emf without the internal resistor part, because $V = IR$, the formula above is equivalent to:

$\displaystyle \epsilon = V - Ir$

## Key Equation

$\displaystyle \epsilon = I(R + r)$
