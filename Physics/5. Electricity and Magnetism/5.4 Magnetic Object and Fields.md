# 5.4 Magnetic Object and Fields

## 1. Electromagnetic Fields

The **magnetic field** is a region around a magnetic material or a moving electric charge within which the force of magnetism acts.

### Right-hand rule

The direction of magnetic field line loops is determined by the **right-hand rule**. Point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of conventional current flow: Your fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field lines as shown in **the figure below**.

### Right-hand rule (solenoid)

To determine the direction of the magnetic field in a solenoid, follow these steps:

1. Place your hand over the first loop where the current enters the solenoid.
2. Point your right hand's thumb in the direction of the current flow.
3. Slightly curl your fingers - they indicate the direction of the magnetic field, either into or out of the solenoid, at that location.

The figure below demonstrates how the rule works:

## 2. Electromagnetic Force

### EM Force on a charge-carrying conductor

The magnitude of the **electromagnetic force** on a straight current-carrying conductor of length $l$, current $I$, in a magnetic field of strength $B$ is:

$F = BIl \times \sin{\theta}$

where $\theta$ is the angle between $I$ and $B$.

The unit of magnetic field strength $B$ is Tesla ($\text{T}$), named after Nikola Tesla.

### EM Force on a moving charge

Assume a charge $q$ moves through an electromagnetic field $B$ with speed $v$, as shown in the figure below:

According to $q = It$,

$\displaystyle I = \frac{q}{t}$
$l = vt$

$\displaystyle \therefore F = BIl \times \sin{\theta} = B(\frac{q}{t})vt \times \sin{\theta} = qvB \times \sin{\theta}$

Therefore, we infer that the EM force acting on a charge in an electromagnetic field is:

$F = qvB \times \sin{\theta}$

where $q$ is the charge, $v$ is the speed of charge, $B$ is the magnetic field strength, and $\theta$ is the angle between $q$ and $B$.

## Key Equations

$F = BIl \times \sin{\theta}$
$F = qvB \times \sin{\theta}$
