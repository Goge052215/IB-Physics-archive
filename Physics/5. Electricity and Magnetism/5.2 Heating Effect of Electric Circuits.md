# 5.2 Heating Effect of Electric Circuits

## 1. Circuits

A current consists of the following components:

1. Electric cell that provides voltage
2. Connecting conductors like wires that assemble the component
3. A resistor that could stop the flow of electrons to generate heat

Circuits often consist of series and parallel sectors, where:

- The series circuit has the same current
- The parallel circuit has the same voltage

The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of resistances:

$\displaystyle \sum R = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3} + \space ...$

In parallel, the reciprocal of total resistance equals the sum of the reciprocal of resistances:

$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\sum R} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}} + \space ...$

### Resistance

The **electrical resistance** ($R$) is the ratio of the potential difference across the component to the current:

$\displaystyle \text{Resistance} = \frac{\text{Potential difference}}{\text {Current}}$

In symbols:

$R = \displaystyle \frac{V}{I}$

The unit of resistance is the **Ohm**, which is the symbol of $\Omega$.

### Ohm's Law

**Ohm's law**Â states that: for a metal held at a constant temperature, the current flowing through it is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.

$I \propto V$

where $I$ is the current, and $V$ is the potential difference

Based on the definition of resistance, we know:

$V = I \times R$

### Resistivity

Different materials have various resistances according to their volume and material properties, which leads to a new quantity called **Resistivity** ($\rho$).

Resistivity is defined as:

$\displaystyle \rho = \frac{RA}{l}$

$\displaystyle R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$

where $R$ is the resistance of the material, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $l$ is the length of the material.

The unit of resistivity is the **ohm-meter** ($\Omega \text{m}^{-1}$)

## 2. Kirchhoff's Circuit Law

### Kirchhoff's First Law

- The sum of the currents into a junction equals the sum of currents away from a junction.
- The total charge flowing into a junction equals the total charge flowing away from the junction.

In symbols:

$\displaystyle \sum I = 0$

This is known as **Kirchhoff's 1st Law**, which is equivalent to the law of **conservation of charge**.

In the image above, $I_{1}+ I_{2} = I_{3}$. According to Kirchhoff's law, the total current that flows into the node equals the total current that flows out:

$I_{\text{In}} = I_{1} + I_{2}$\
$I_{\text{Out}} = I_{3}$

$\because I_{\text{In}} = I_{\text{Out}}$\
$\therefore I_{1}+ I_{2} = I_{3}$

### Kirchhoff's Second Law

Kirchhoff's Second Law states that in any closed loop in a circuit, the net electric potential difference must be zero:

$\displaystyle \sum V = 0$

Overall, Kirchhoff's Current Law states that:

$\displaystyle\sum I = 0 \space (\mbox{node})$\
$\displaystyle\sum V = 0 \space (\mbox{in a loop})$
## 3. Power

The **electrical power** ($P$) in a circuit equals the product of potential difference and current. It measures the amount of work done by electricity per second.

In symbols:

$P = I \times V$

where $I$ is the current, $V$ is the potential difference. Therefore, the unit of power is $\text{Cs}^{-1} \times \text{JC}^{-1} = \text{Js}^{-1}$, where we denote as **Watt**.

Based on the Ohm's Law $V = I \times R$, we could transform the power equation into:

$\displaystyle P = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R$

## Key Equations

### Circuits

$\displaystyle \sum R = R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{3}+\space...$

$\displaystyle \frac{1}{\sum R} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}} + \space ...$

$\displaystyle R = \frac{V}{I}$

$\displaystyle \rho = \frac{RA}{l}$

### Kirchhoff's Law

$\displaystyle\sum I = 0 (\mbox{node})$\
$\displaystyle\sum V = 0 (\mbox{in a loop})$

### Power

$\displaystyle P = I \times V = \frac{V^2}{R} = I^2R$
