# 2.3 Work, Energy, and Power

## 1. Work and Energy

### Work

**Mechanic work done** is a measure of energy transfer when a force moves an object over a distance. 

It is defined as the product of the force applied to an object and the distance the object moves in the direction of the force. Mathematically, work done ($W$) is expressed as:

$W=F\times s\times\cos{\theta}$

where $F$ is the force, $s$ is the distance the object moved, and $\theta$ is the angle the force acts.

**Work**Â is a scalar quantity obtained by a particular type of multiplication of two vectors (mathematically known as the dot product or the scalar product).

### Energy

**Energy Types:**

**1. Kinetic energy** ($E_k$) is the energy that an object possesses due to its motion. 

Suppose that external forces act on an object that has an initial velocity $v_0$ and a final velocity $v$. According to the formula: $W=Fs$, $F=ma$ and $v^2={v_0}^2+2as$

$\displaystyle W=Fs=mas=m(\frac{v^2-{v_0}^2}{2})$
$\displaystyle\therefore E_k=\frac{1}{2}\times v^2$

From the equation above, the kinetic energy of an object depends on its mass and the square of its velocity, indicating that the energy increases with both a higher mass and a higher speed.

**2. Gravitational potential energy** ($E_{PG}$) is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field. 

It is a form of potential energy ($E_P$) dependent on the height of the object relative to a reference point, usually the Earth's surface, as well as the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational field.

It is the product of an object's mass $m$, gravitational field strength $g$, and height above the reference origin $h$:

$E_{PG}=m\times g\times h$

**3. Elastic potential energy** is the energy stored in elastic materials as the result of their stretching or compressing. Elastic potential energy is a type of potential energy ($E_P$), which means it is stored energy that can be converted into kinetic energy or other forms of energy when the object returns to its original shape.

**Hooke's Law** states the force needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance is proportional to that distance. 

Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$F=k\Delta x$

where $k$ is called the spring constant, which has units of $\text{Nm}^{-1}$, and $\Delta x$ is the displacement.

The elastic potential energy ($E_{PE}$) stored in a spring or any elastic material can be then derived from Hooke's Law by integrating the function of force $F$:

$\displaystyle E_{PE}=W=\int F\space dx=\int k\Delta x\space dx=\frac{1}{2}k(\Delta x)^2$

hence,

$\displaystyle E_P=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$

### Conservation of Energy

**The principle of conservation of energy** states that energy **cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed** from one form to another or transferred from one object to another.

This means that the total energy, the sum of both kinetic and potential energy, in an isolated system remains constant over time:

$\displaystyle\sum\limits E=E_k+E_P=\text{Constant}$

The figure below shows how energy is conserved for a pendulum:

This principle is also formally known as the **first law of thermodynamics** when applied to thermodynamic systems.

## 2. Power

**Power** ($P$) in physics is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred over time. It quantifies how quickly work is done or energy is moved from one form to another or transferred from one place to another.

The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt ($\text{W}$), which is equivalent to one joule per second ($\text{J}\text{s}^{-1}$).

Mathematically, power ($P$) can be expressed as:

$P=\displaystyle\frac{W}{t}$

Based on that work done equals the multiplication of Force $F$ and distance $s$, power also equals to:

$\displaystyle P=\frac{F\times s}{t}=F\times v$

where $v$ is the velocity of an object.

### Efficiency

**Efficiency** is the amount of work, energy, or power that is retained in a process:

$\displaystyle\text{Efficiency}=\frac{\text{Useful Output of Energy}}{\text{Total Energy}}$

## Key Formulas
