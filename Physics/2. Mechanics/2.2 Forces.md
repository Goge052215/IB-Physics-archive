# 2.2 Forces

## 1. Newton's Laws

### Newton's First Law

**Newton's First Law**, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force.

In simpler terms, it means that if something is sitting still, it will stay still unless something pushes or pulls on it. Similarly, if something is moving, it will keep moving at the same speed and in the same direction unless something interferes with its motion.

### Newton's Second Law

**Newton's Second Law of Motion** states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object and inversely proportional to its mass.

This law can be mathematically expressed as:

$F = m \times a$

This equation states that force $F$ equals mass $m$ times acceleration $a$. The appropriate SI unit for force $F$ can be thus defined as $kg \cdot ms^{-2}$.

### Newton's Third Law

**Newton's Third Law** states that every action has an equal and opposite direction.

This law highlights the mutual interactions between objects: forces always come in pairs: action and reaction forces.

These force pairs act on two different objects and are of the same type (e.g., both are gravitational, electrical, or mechanical forces).

Importantly, the action and reaction forces act on different objects, so they do not cancel each other out.

## 2. Free Body Diagram (FBD) and Equilibrium

Key components and principles of Free Body Diagrams include:

1. **Isolation of the Object:** The first step in creating an FBD is to 'isolate' the object of interest from its surroundings. This means you consider the object by itself, free from its environment, hence the term "free body."
2. **Representation of Forces:** All the forces acting on the object are represented as vectors (arrows). These include gravitational forces, normal forces, frictional forces, tension forces, applied forces, and air resistance, among others. The length of each arrow reflects the magnitude of the force, and the direction of the arrow shows the direction in which the force acts.
3. **Labeling:** Each force is labeled next to its corresponding arrow to identify the type of force and, where applicable, its magnitude and direction.
4. **Equilibrium:** In many cases, FBDs are used to analyze situations where the object is in equilibrium, meaning the sum of all forces acting on the object is zero. This allows for the application of Newton's first law (an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force).

**Nb:** It is advised to label the gravity force as $W$, the symbol of 'weight'

### Translational Equilibrium

**Translational equilibrium** refers to a state where an object is either at rest or moving with a constant velocity, implying that it is not accelerating.

In other words, the net force acting on the object is zero:

$\displaystyle \sum F=0$, $\space\displaystyle\sum F_x=0$ and $\displaystyle\sum F_y=0$

There are two conditions associated with translational equilibrium:
1. **Static Equilibrium:** This occurs when an object is at rest and not moving. The object is in static equilibrium when all the forces acting upon it balance out, and there is no net force causing it to start moving.
2. **Dynamic Equilibrium:** This occurs when an object is moving with a constant velocity (which could also be zero). In this case, the object is in dynamic equilibrium because, even though it may be moving, there is no net force causing a change in its velocity (acceleration).

In symbols:
1. Static Equilibrium: $v=0$ and $\sum\limits F=0$
2. Dynamic Equilibrium: $|v|=0$ and $\sum\limits F=0$

## 3. Friction

**Friction** is a force that **opposes the relative motion or the attempted motion** between two surfaces in contact.

Two types of friction forces between the surface contact:
1. **Static friction:** occurs when there is no movement between the surfaces
2. **Dynamic friction:** occurs when there is relative movement

### Static Friction

The static friction force $F_{fs}$ can be expressed empirically as: 

$F_{fs} \le \mu_sN$

where $F_{fs}$ is the static friction force, $\mu_s$ is **the coefficient of static friction**, and $N$ is the normal force.

Once the pull on the block is equal to $F_{fs}$, the block is ready to move, when the external force passes this threshold, the block starts to slide and the friction force will turn into dynamic friction force.

### Dynamic Friction

Dynamic friction only applies to moving objects relative to others. The friction force $F_{fd}$ then returns to the threshold (as mentioned above) and remains constant:

$F_{fd}=\mu_dN$

where $\mu_d$ is the **coefficient of dynamic friction**

**Nb:** $\mu_s$ and $\mu_d$ can sometimes vary differently depending on the pair of surfaces.

### Terminal Speed

**Terminal speed** is the maximum speed that an object reaches when the **force of gravity is balanced by the resistance** of the medium through which the object is moving, such as air or water.

At terminal speed, the **acceleration of the object becomes zero because the net force acting on the object is zero**. This means that the object continues to **move at a constant speed**.

## Key Formulas

### Newton's Second Law

$F=m\times a$

### Friction

$F_{f\text{static}}\le \mu_{\text{static}}N$\
$F_{f\text{dynamic}}=\mu_{\text{dynamic}}N$
