# 2.1 Motion

## 1. Speed and Velocity

**Speed** is the rate of change of distance to time.

**Velocity** is a vector that is the rate of change of displacement to time.

## 2. Acceleration

Similar to velocity (which is the rate of changing displacement), **acceleration** is a vector that is the rate of change of velocity to time.

Hence, the acceleration can be defined as:

$a = \displaystyle \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

### Average vs. Instantaneous values

When calculating any rate of change to time we divide by a time interval. This produces an average value of the speed, velocity, or acceleration during that time interval. 

We cannot assume that the speed, velocity, or acceleration was a constant value in the time interval.

## 3. Position-Time Graph

We can find the velocity from the gradient (slope) of the line because (using $\Delta$, the mathematical symbol for change):

$v = \displaystyle \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$

### Key

**On a position–time or displacement–time graph:**

- A stationary object produces a horizontal (slope of zero; constant value) linear graph
- An object moving with constant velocity produces a linear graph
- An object moving with constant acceleration produces a parabolic graph with an increasing slope (a quadratic, not yet proven)
- an object moving with non-uniform acceleration object produces a graph that is neither quadratic nor linear (not yet proven);
- the graph intercept at $t = 0$ is the displacement at $t = 0$
- the gradient of the graph at any time is the instantaneous velocity of the object at that time.

### Worked Example

Objects A, B, and C have their motions along a straight, narrow road recorded in the position–time graph shown in the figure below.

Q1. Describe the motion of each object, including velocity and position, during the different portions of their motion.

- Object A moves at a constant velocity of $v_\text{A} = \frac{10}{12} = 0.83 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ and achieve $10 \text{ m}$ after $12 \text{ s}$.
- Object B: moved with a constant velocity of $v_{\text{B}1} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the first $4.0 \text{ s}$, then remained at rest for $4.0\text{ s}$, then moved with a constant velocity of $v_{\text{B}3} = -\frac{10}{4} = -2.5 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the last $4.0\text{ s}$. It returned to its starting point after $12 \text{ s}$.
- Object C: moved with a constant velocity of  $v_{\text{C}1} = \frac{7.5}{6} = 1.3 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the first $6.0\text{ s}$ , then moved with a constant velocity of  $v_{\text{C}2} = -\frac{7.5}{6} = -1.3 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the last $6.0\text{ s}$. It returned to its starting point after $12 \text{ s}$.

Q2. Do any of these objects "brush" one another? If so, when and where? If not, why not?

- The Object A encounters the Object C at $6 \text{ m}, 7.2 \text{ s}$
- The Object A encounters the Object B at $7.5 \text{ m}, 9 \text{ s}$

## 4. Velocity-Time Graph

The image above shows the relationship between the velocity of a motorcyclist and time. The gradient of the velocity–time graph gives us the acceleration of the motorcyclist. In this case, if we choose the points named Initial velocity and Final velocity on the graph line we have:

$a = \displaystyle \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

which corresponds to the formula of acceleration in Part 2.

### The area below the v-t graph

The area beneath a velocity-time graph over some time interval produces a physical quantity with units of $m ⋅ s^{−1} × s = m$, which is the change in position (the displacement) during the time interval.

$\displaystyle \int{v}\space dt = s$

This integral shows that the area below the velocity-time graph is the object's displacement.

### Key

**On a velocity-time graph:**

- A stationary object produces a graph with a horizontal constant velocity value of zero.
- An object moving with constant velocity produces a horizontal linear graph with slope zero.
- A constantly (uniformly) accelerating object produces a linear graph (not yet proven).
- A non-uniformly accelerating object produces a non-linear graph (not yet proven).
- The gradient of the graph at any time is the instantaneous acceleration of the object at that time.
- The area beneath the graph during a time interval equals the displacement during that time interval.
- Only displacement (and not position) can be determined.

## 5. Uniformly Accelerated Motion

**Uniform linear acceleration** is motion in a straight line with constant acceleration, resulting in a constant change in velocity over equal time intervals.

### SUVAT Derivation

$v = v_{0} + at$, $\displaystyle s = \frac{1}{2} \times v \times t$\
$\displaystyle \therefore s = \frac{1}{2} \times (v_{0} + at) \times t$\
$\displaystyle \therefore s = v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2} at^2$

$\displaystyle \because s = \frac{(v_0+v)t}{2}$

$\displaystyle \therefore v^{2} = {v_0}^{2} + 2as$

**Important:** Each equation has **one** missing parameter: v,s,a,t

## 6. Projectile Motion

**Projectile motion** refers to the motion of an object thrown or projected into the air, subject to only the acceleration of gravity. The object is called a projectile, and its path is called its trajectory.

### Key characteristics of projectile motion

**Two-Dimensional Motion:** Projectile motion is a form of two-dimensional motion or motion in a plane. It can be understood as two motions simultaneously happening: horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis). The horizontal motion occurs at a constant velocity, while the vertical motion is influenced by gravity, causing the object to accelerate downwards.

**Parabolic Trajectory:** A parabola is a projectile's trajectory under gravity alone (assuming no air resistance). This path is due to the constant acceleration downwards from gravity, while the horizontal component of the velocity remains constant.

**Components of Projectile Motion:** 
- **Horizontal Component:** Constant velocity, unaffected by gravity, assuming no air resistance.
- **Vertical Component:** Accelerated motion, affected by gravity. The vertical velocity changes linearly with time due to this constant acceleration.

**Equations of Motion:** The motion of a projectile can be predicted or analyzed using the equations of motion, with separate equations for the horizontal and vertical components. For example, assuming the acceleration due to gravity (g) is constant and air resistance is negligible:

- Horizontal distance $x = v_{0x} \cdot t$, where $v_{0x}$ is the initial horizontal velocity and $t$ is the time.
- Vertical distance $y = v_{0y} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$, where $v_{0y}$ is the initial vertical velocity.

From basic trigonometry, we could derive that:

$v_{0y}=v_{0}\times\sin{\theta}$\
$v_{0x}=v_{0}\times\cos{\theta}$

$\therefore x=v_{0x}\times t=v_0\times\cos{\theta}\times t$\
$\displaystyle\therefore y=v_{0y}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}=v_0\times\sin{\theta}\times t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$

Based on the Pythagorean Theorem:

$s=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$

The total time of flight and the maximum height reached can also be calculated using these principles.

## Key Formulas

### Acceleration

$\displaystyle a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

### SUVAT

$\displaystyle s=v_0t+\frac{1}{2}at^2$\
$v^2={v_0}^2+2as$\
$v=v_0+at$

### Projectile

$x=v_{0x}\times t=v_0\times\cos{\theta}\times t$\
$\displaystyle y=v_{0y}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}=v_0\times\sin{\theta}\times t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$

$s=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
