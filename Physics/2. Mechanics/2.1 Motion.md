# 2.1 Motion

## 1. Speed and Velocity

Speed is the rate of change of distance to time.

Velocity is a vector that is the rate of change of displacement to time.

## 2. Acceleration

Similar to velocity (which is the rate of changing displacement), acceleration is a vector that is the rate of change of velocity to time.

Hence, the acceleration can be defined as:

$a = Δv/Δt$

### Average vs. Instantaneous values

When calculating any rate of change to time we divide by a time interval. This produces an average value of the speed, velocity, or acceleration during that time interval. 

We cannot assume that the speed, velocity, or acceleration was a constant value in the time interval.

## 3. Position-Time Graph

This example illustrates time on horizontal axis and position on vertical axis. Displacement of the object is $10 \text{ m}$. In 10 second, the displacement is $100 \text{ m}$. Therefore, velocity is $100 \text{ m} / 10 \text{ s} = 10 \text{ ms}^{–1}$ for the whole course of motion.

We can find the velocity from the gradient (slope) of the line because (using $Δ$, the mathematical symbol for change):

$v = Δs / Δt$

### Key

**On a position–time or displacement–time graph:**

- A stationary object produces a horizontal (slope of zero; constant value) linear graph
- An object moving with constant velocity produces a linear graph
- An object moving with constant acceleration produces a parabolic graph with an increasing slope (a quadratic, not yet proven)
- an object moving with non-uniform acceleration object produces a graph that is neither quadratic nor linear (not yet proven);
- the graph intercept at $t = 0$ is the displacement at $t = 0$
- the gradient of the graph at any time is the instantaneous velocity of the object at that time.

### Worked Example

Objects A, B, and C have their motions along a straight, narrow road recorded in the position–time graph shown in the figure below.

Q1. Describe the motion of each object, including velocity and positions, during the different portions of their motion.

- Object A moves in a constant velocity of $v_\text{A} = \frac{10}{12} = 0.83 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ and achieve $10 \text{ m}$ after $12 \text{ s}$.
- Object B: moved with constant velocity of $v_{\text{B}1} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the first $4.0 \text{ s}$, then remained at rest for $4.0\text{ s}$, then moved with constant velocity of $v_{\text{B}3} = -\frac{10}{4} = -2.5 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the last $4.0\text{ s}$. It returned to its starting point after $12 \text{ s}$.
- Object C: moved with constant velocity of  $v_{\text{C}1} = \frac{7.5}{6} = 1.3 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the first $6.0\text{ s}$ , then moved with constant velocity of  $v_{\text{C}2} = -\frac{7.5}{6} = -1.3 \text{ ms}^{-1}$ for the last $6.0\text{ s}$. It returned to its starting point after $12 \text{ s}$.

Q2. Do any of these objects "brush" one another? If so, when and where? If not, why not?

- The Object A encounters the Object C at $6 \text{ m}, 7.2 \text{ s}$
- The Object A encounters the Object B at $7.5 \text{ m}, 9 \text{ s}$

The image above shows the relationship between the velocity of motorcyclist and time. The gradient of the velocity–time graph gives us the acceleration of the motorcyclist. In this case if we choose the points named Initial velocity and Final velocity on the graph line we have:

$a = Δv / Δt$

which corresponds to the formula of acceleration in Part 2.

### The area below the v-t graph

The area beneath a velocity–time graph over some time interval produces a physical quantity with units of $m ⋅ s^{−1} × s = m$, which is the change in position (the displacement) during the time interval.

$\int{v}\,dt = s$

This integral shows that the area below the velocity-time graph is the displacement of the object.

### Key

**On a velocity–time graph:**

- A stationary object produces a graph with a horizontal constant velocity value of zero.
- An object moving with constant velocity produces a horizontal linear graph with slope zero.
- A constantly (uniformly) accelerating object produces a linear graph (not yet proven).
- A non-uniformly accelerating object produces a non-linear graph (not yet proven).
- The gradient of the graph at any time is the instantaneous acceleration of the object at that time.
- The area beneath the graph during a time interval equals the displacement during that time interval.
- Only displacement (and not position) can be determined.

### Worked Example

Objects A and B travelling the same narrow, straight road have their motions recorded in the velocity–time graph shown in the figure below.
