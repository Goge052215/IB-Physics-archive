# 2.4 Momentum

**Momentum** ($p$) is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the quantity of motion an object has. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. Momentum is directly proportional to the object's mass and velocity:

$p\propto m$, $p\propto v$

and is calculated using the formula:

$p=m\times v$

where $m$ is the mass of the object, and $v$ is the velocity of the object.

### Properties of Momentum:

- **Vector Quantity:** Since velocity is a vector, momentum is also a vector, having both magnitude and direction. The direction of the momentum vector is the same as the direction of the velocity vector.
- **Conservation of Momentum:** In a closed system, where no external forces are acting, the total momentum before any interaction (like collisions) is equal to the total momentum after the interaction. This principle is known as the conservation of momentum and is a fundamental law of physics.
- **Impulse:** The change in an object's momentum is called impulse, a vector quantity that can be represented as the change in momentum of an object.

### Impulse

Newton's Second Law states that a net force will cause a proportional change in momentum:

$\displaystyle F=ma=m\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$

$\displaystyle\because m\Delta v=\Delta p\space\rightarrow\displaystyle\frac{m\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v}$

$\displaystyle\therefore F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v}$

The **impulse** ($J$) of an average force ($F$) applied over a time interval ($\Delta t$) is:

$J=F\Delta t=\Delta p$

Impulse is a change in the momentum of an object. It is a **vector quantity** and its units are typically expressed as $\text{N}\cdot\text{s}$.

### Conservation of momentum

The conservation of momentum states that the **total momentum** of a closed system (a system not subject to external forces) **is constant over time**:

$p_{\text{initial}}=p_{\text{final}}$

The principle of conservation of momentum implies that if the total external force acting on a system is zero, the total momentum of the system before any interaction must equal the total momentum of the system after the interaction.

Momentum is always conserved in collisions, while kinetic energy is only conserved in elastic collision:

| Collision           | Features                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elastic Collision   | Both kinetic energy & momentum are conserved: $p_{\text{initial}}=p_{\text{final}}$, $E_{k\space\text{initial}}=E_{k\space\text{final}}$                    |
| Inelastic Collision | Momentum is conserved, while kinetic energy is not conserved: $p_{\text{initial}}=p_{\text{final}}$, $E_{k\space\text{initial}}\gt E_{k\space\text{final}}$ |
